# 🟢 Welcome to SLIME

We're a collective of developers building **Free and Open Source Software** on the **Hedera network**! Like our name suggests, we're flexible, resilient, and we stick together to create something bigger than the sum of our parts!

## 🧪 What We're Brewing

- 🔗 **Hedera-native applications** that push the boundaries of what's possible
- 🌱 **Community-driven tools** that make development on Hedera more accessible 
- 🎯 **Innovative solutions** that solve real problems in the decentralized space
- 📚 **Educational resources** to help others join the ecosystem

## 🎮 Our Philosophy

```
if (problem.exists()) {
  slime.adapt();
  slime.collaborate();
  slime.buildSolution();
  slime.shareWithCommunity();
}
```

## 🌟 Why FOSS on Hedera?

We believe in:
- **Transparency** - Code should be open for everyone to inspect and improve
- **Sustainability** - Hedera's energy-efficient consensus keeps us green
- **Innovation** - The best ideas come from collaboration, not competition
- **Community** - Together we're stronger (and more fun!)
