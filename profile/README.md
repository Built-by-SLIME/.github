# ðŸŸ¢ Welcome to SLIME

We're a collective of developers building **Free and Open Source Software** on the **Hedera network**! Like our name suggests, we're flexible, resilient, and we stick together to create something bigger than the sum of our parts!

## ðŸ§ª What We're Cooking

- âœ… **Hedera-native applications** - that push the boundaries of what's possible
- âœ… **Community-driven tools** - that make development on Hedera more accessible 
- âœ… **Innovative solutions** - that solve real problems in the decentralized space
- âœ… **Retail-driven tools** - to usher more people into Hedera

## ðŸŽ® Our Philosophy

```
if (problem.exists()) {
  slime.adapt();
  slime.collaborate();
  slime.buildSolution();
  slime.shareWithCommunity();
}
```
